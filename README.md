# GPIO Lab

Welcome to the GPIO lab! In this project, you'll learn how to build simple circuits using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. Grab your breadboard and a couple of cables to get started.

## What You'll Need

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LEDs, resistors, and other basic electronic components

## What You'll Do

- Connect components to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins
- Write code to control the GPIO pins (e.g., turn LEDs on/off)
- Experiment with different circuits and sensors

## Getting Started

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi and ensure itâ€™s powered on.
2. Connect your breadboard and components as described in the lab instructions.
3. Run the provided code or scripts to interact with the GPIO pins.
